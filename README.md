In this Project i ventured into data cleaning 
Data Cleaning:

Formatting:
Remove unnecessary formatting (e.g., fonts, colors) for cleaner manipulation.
Ensure consistent decimal places for numerical data.
Apply consistent date formatting.
Missing Values:
Identify and handle missing values (e.g., remove rows, impute values).
Document the approach taken for missing values.
Inconsistent Data:
Clean inconsistent text entries (e.g., standardize capitalization, remove typos).
Standardize units of measurement (e.g., convert all currencies to USD).
Error Correction:
Identify and correct any errors in the data (e.g., outliers, invalid entries).
Document the errors found and how they were corrected.

PivotTables:

Once your data is cleaned, you can use pivot tables to summarize and analyze the data in various ways.
Go to the Insert tab and click PivotTable.
Choose where you want to place the pivot table (New Worksheet or Existing Worksheet).
In the PivotTable Fields pane, drag and drop fields to the Rows, Columns, Values, and Filters sections to create your desired analysis.
